So you want to contribute to UnityToolbag. I appreciate it! Here are some things to keep in mind.

1. If you're submitting bug fixes or _tiny_ feature changes, feel free to open up a pull request. I'm always happy to have people help keep things working.
2. Always feel welcome to open up an issue to discuss a potential bug or a feature you think would be helpful. I can't guarantee I'll be able to implement anything (I'm quite time limited these days) but it doesn't hurt anything, either.

# Code Guidelines

1. Please try to use spaces instead of tabs when submitting fixes. I like spaces and would like to keep the code consistent.
2. Please try to follow any existing naming conventions when submitting fixes.

# Third Party Tools

If you're creating a big feature change or entirely new features, please create a new repository (not a fork of UnityToolbag!) and put your code there. Then send a pull request adding your repository URL to the main README.

I'm not trying to be mean with this rule; it is largely meant to keep me from being a gatekeeper for other people's tools. My time is pretty limited these days and I'd rather not have to review pull requests for things that I'm not working on.

The second reason for this is to avoid building a giant mega-repo. I'd prefer to see smaller tools get their own repositories so that people aren't pulling in a bunch of stuff they don't want just to get a few small tools that aren't dependent on other code.

Again, nothing personal but I want to keep things nice and easy for everyone.
