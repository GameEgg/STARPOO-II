# Sync Solution

This is a simple editor script that adds a new menu item, "Sync Solution", to the Assets menu. This menu item will synchronize the C# project and solution without opening it. This is useful if you prefer to use Sublime Text or other editors using [Omnisharp](http://www.omnisharp.net) where you need the solution and projects but don't actually need to directly open them.

The menu item also binds `Shift-Alt-S` to the functionality, for quicker access when working. If you add/remove scripts, a quick `Shift-Alt-S` will ensure your projects are updated.

This script is based on [this post on Unity Answers](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/1123117/is-there-a-way-to-run-assets-open-c-project-withou.html).
